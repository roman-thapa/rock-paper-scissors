Classic rock paper scissor game

In this I used number two different methods to represent choice / take input of user and computer.
First method using numbers.
In both method I used number to represent random choice of computer and assigned them as computer's choice.
In number method numbers represented certain choice and game will proceed further with that choice.
In letters method, user will input their choice in prompt box. Then game will proceed with the user choice.
You can play this game from this [link](https://roman-thapa.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) or the title itself
